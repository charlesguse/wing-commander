"""Gate 93 — board-loop.yml's agent steps read the issue only through
wing-commander-issue-context, and nothing re-implements its trust filter.

WHY THIS EXISTS
----------------
#499 code review, round 3 (B1, blocking): board-loop.yml's route stage
was granted `Bash(gh issue view:*)` and told to run
`gh issue view N --comments` directly, reading every comment on a public
issue unfiltered, then flowing pr-title/pr-body into
`gh issue create --label spec-request` -- a public commenter could reach
write-capable intake through a bot-authored issue body, bypassing
intake.yml's own comment-trust-gate (specs/029-intake-issue-comments) and,
in spirit, FR-056 (specs/057-autonomous-board-loop: comment selection MUST
be decided in code by author association, never by asking the agent to
ignore the rest). The fix (this same PR) moved that filter into
`wing-commander-issue-context` (`.github/actions/`), the single home both
intake.yml and board-loop.yml now consume, and removed every
`Bash(gh issue view:*)`/`Bash(gh api...)` grant board-loop.yml's agent
steps had. This gate is what keeps both true after the next edit.

WHAT IT CHECKS
--------------
1. tool-grant: every `wing-commander-tool-args` call site in
   `.github/workflows/board-loop.yml` -- its `default-allowed-tools`,
   `extra-allowed-tools` and `allowed-tools-override` inputs -- must not
   contain `gh issue view` or `gh api` (case-sensitive, the exact `gh`
   subcommand text an allowlist fragment like `Bash(gh issue view:*)`
   would carry). Scoped to board-loop.yml only: intake.yml legitimately
   grants its own agent `Bash(gh issue view:*)` for title/body (it never
   grants comment access that way -- comments are staged, code-filtered,
   by the same composite), and this gate is not the place to relitigate
   that design.
2. single-home: no file other than
   `.github/actions/wing-commander-issue-context/action.yml` may contain
   all three fragments unique to its trust-filter idiom together --
   `select(.user.type != "Bot")`, a paginated fetch of an issue's
   `/comments` endpoint, and the `"## Comment by @` staging template.
   Individually each fragment is generic (`--paginate` and
   `author_association` checks exist all over this repository for
   unrelated purposes -- comment-reply triggers, PR review gating,
   auto-release's own actor check); this gate matches only their
   co-occurrence in one file, the same "literal fragments unique to the
   idiom, checked together" methodology Gate 60
   (verify-single-home-idioms.py) uses for its own idioms.

`--self-test`: synthetic tempdir fixtures prove each check can fail (a
board-loop tool-args grant carrying `gh issue view`, and a second file
re-implementing all three trust-filter fragments), and that the real
fleet passes both.
