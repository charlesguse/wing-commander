# Specification Quality Checklist: Configurable Human Review Gates

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Two [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (FR-011 gate scope vs. constitution
  non-negotiables; FR-012 configuration granularity). These are the two decisions
  with genuine scope/security impact and no safe default. They are posted to the
  lifecycle issue for the requester/maintainers to answer; the rest of the spec is
  complete and internally consistent.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`.
